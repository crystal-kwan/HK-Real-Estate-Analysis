# HK-Real-Estate-Analysis
Evaluate real estate affordability, bubble size and risk

The project analyses average housing prices, Monthly Median Household Income (MMHI) and best-lending rates over the past two decades.
It calculates and derives actual home price from predetermined average mortgage payment commitment, mortgage rate formula, and down payment against loan value. 

The size of bubble is then implied by actual home price less affordable home price. 
The probability of bubble sustaining is calculated and visualization of the growing bubble size is generated.
