# HK-Real-Estate-Analysis
Analyze real estate affordability, bubble size and risk

The project downloads average housing prices, Monthly Median Household Income (MMHI) and best-lending rates over the past two decades from HKMA and CENSTATD.
It calculates and derives actual home price from predetermined average mortgage payment commitment, mortgage rate formula, and down payment against loan value. 

The size of bubble is then implied by actual home price less affordable home price. 
The probability of bubble sustaining is calculated and visualization of the growing bubble size is generated.
